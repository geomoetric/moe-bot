For my capstone project, I will join machine intelligence and design. Machine Intelligence and AI are complex concepts that need explanation. It means my algorithm will model thinking, perception, and actions to produce designs. Today, artificial intelligence and design mix as art experiments or as separated processes. I will take this farther to  join these opposites. To use machine intelligence to create and iterate a design object. Since no one else is working this way, my goal is to create a functional proof of concept. This prototype will both be a designed object and produce iterations of MI design. My product is a website which designs modernist layouts with text and geometric art.
